Bump-on-Tail (BOT)
==================

BOT is a Matlab tool for studying the electrostatic instability in the bump-on-tail problem in plasma physics.

The tool has a graphical user interface that enables the user to see how the instability evolves in real time.

This project was originally created on [Google Code](https://code.google.com/archive/p/bump-on-tail/) in 2011 as a product of my postdoctoral work at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden.
